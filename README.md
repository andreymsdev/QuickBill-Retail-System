## Technologies Used

## How It Works
1. The user enters an item name, quantity, and unit price.
2. Items are stored in an array and rendered dynamically in a table.
3. The system calculates the subtotal, tax (10%), and grand total automatically.
4. An invoice ID and the current date are generated when the first item is added.
5. The invoice can be printed or reset at any time.

## Custom Feature
**Automatic Invoice ID and Date**  
Each invoice generates a random unique ID and displays the current date, simulating a real retail invoice system.
